# APS Glossary

- **APS**: Autodesk Platform Services (formerly Forge)
- **ACC**: Autodesk Construction Cloud
- **BIM 360**: Legacy construction management platform (predecessor to ACC)
- **MD**: Model Derivative API — translates design files into viewable formats (SVF/SVF2)
- **DM**: Data Management API — manages files, folders, and storage (OSS, BIM 360, ACC hubs)
- **URN**: Base64-encoded resource identifier used across APS APIs
- **SVF/SVF2**: Scalable Viewing Format — optimized 3D web viewing format produced by Model Derivative and consumed exclusively by the APS Viewer SDK, similar concept to glTF format with openCTM compression
- **OSS**: Object Storage Service — APS cloud storage for uploading design files
- **Webhook**: Server-to-server callback triggered by APS events (e.g., model translation complete)
- **2LO/3LO**: Two-legged / three-legged OAuth authentication flows
- **Hub**: Top-level container in Data Management (maps to an ACC or BIM 360 account)
- **Manifest**: Translation status and output metadata from Model Derivative

- **ACAD**: AutoCAD — Autodesk's flagship 2D/3D CAD drafting software (produces .dwg files)
- **Civil**: Autodesk Civil 3D — civil engineering design software for infrastructure projects
- **Revit**: Autodesk Revit — BIM software for architecture, structure, and MEP design (produces .rvt files)
- **Build**: Autodesk Build — construction management module within ACC (field management, cost, etc.)
- **IFC**: Industry Foundation Classes — open standard file format for BIM data exchange between tools
- **RFI**: Request for Information — formal question submitted during construction, tracked in ACC/BIM 360
- **SSA**: Secure Service Accounts — service-level authentication for server-to-server APS access
- **AEC**: Architecture, Engineering, and Construction — the industry vertical APS primarily serves
- **AECDM**: AEC Data Model API — unified API for accessing design and construction data across ACC
- **DX**: Data Exchange — API for exchanging design data between applications in a neutral format
- **Auth**: Authentication — APS OAuth flows including 2LO, 3LO, PKCE, PAT (Personal Access Tokens), and SSA

## APS Documentation URL Structure

APS docs are served behind a CDN with a path key (`bPlouYTd`). Each API source has a
JSON Table-of-Contents (TOC) and corresponding HTML pages:

- **TOC JSON**: `https://developer.doc.config.autodesk.com/bPlouYTd/{source}.json`
  where `{source}` is a source ID from the table below (e.g. `acc_v1.json`, `data_v2.json`)
- **Static HTML pages**: `https://developer.doc.autodesk.com/bPlouYTd/{path_from_toc}`
  (these are the CDN-hosted pages referenced in each TOC JSON's `source` field)
- **APS Portal page**: the human-readable documentation on `aps.autodesk.com` (JavaScript SPA)

| `webhooks_v1.json` | Webhooks API | https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/webhooks/v1/developers_guide/overview/ |

To construct a reference link from search results, use the `source` metadata field with the
base URL. For example, a chunk with `source: webhooks_v1` means its TOC is at
`https://developer.doc.config.autodesk.com/bPlouYTd/webhooks_v1.json` and its HTML pages
are under `https://developer.doc.autodesk.com/bPlouYTd/webhooks_v1/`.

### Converting a Static CDN URL to an APS Portal URL

The static CDN pages can be mapped back to the original APS portal (the JavaScript SPA
at `aps.autodesk.com`). This is useful for generating clickable links that open in a
browser with full navigation.

A static CDN URL looks like:
`https://developer.doc.autodesk.com/bPlouYTd/{repo-slug}/{api-name}/{version}/{path}/{page}.html`

For example:
- `https://developer.doc.autodesk.com/bPlouYTd/A360-platform-viewing-docs-master-633741/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/model-derivative/formats-GET.html`
- `https://developer.doc.autodesk.com/bPlouYTd/design-automation-forge-doc-master-636116/design-automation/v3/reference/http/design-automation/activities-GET.html`

To convert to a portal URL:

1. **Strip the repo-slug** — the first path segment after `bPlouYTd/`. It always has a
   numeric suffix (e.g. `A360-platform-viewing-docs-master-633741`).
2. **The api-name is the next segment** — e.g. `model-derivative`, `design-automation`.
3. **Remove any duplicate api-name** — the api-name sometimes appears again deeper in the
   path (right before the page filename). If it does, remove that duplicate folder.
4. **Strip `.html`** from the page filename and add a trailing `/`.
5. **Prepend** `https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/`.

Examples:

| Static CDN path (after `bPlouYTd/`) | Portal URL |
|---|---|
| `…-633741/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/model-derivative/formats-GET.html` | `https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/formats-GET/` |
| `…-636116/design-automation/v3/reference/http/design-automation/activities-GET.html` | `https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/reference/http/activities-GET/` |
| `…-633590/aecdatamodel/v1/developers_guide/overview.html` | `https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/aecdatamodel/v1/developers_guide/overview/` |

Note: the duplicate api-name folder does not always exist — simpler paths like
`aecdatamodel/v1/developers_guide/overview.html` have no duplicate. Only remove it
if the api-name appears as a path segment again after `{version}/`.
